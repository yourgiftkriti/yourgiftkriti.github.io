        Haha, the most legendary pic for medicinal history! Game-changing revolutionary idea of putting vaseline over a bleeding lip would cure everything! That might be debatable  This is one of the best group pics we ever had? Don't you think? That might be debatable cuz we have so many good pics. But idk why I find this one special. It looks so cute and adorable.

        Gawd, I swear I wanna pull your cheeks in this pic, for no reason really! But you have such pullable cheeks I can't help it. Fml. We still had a pretty large group but things change so quickly. Harshal Anuska left, Anushka was sidelined (more like we moved out of her way) Chintan had his own mood swings, and Shunu the weirdo he (And at that time he was called Labua gawd rofl)Gawd, seeing Aniket reminds me of his actions. How can one guy make every girl feel so uncomfortable it's beyond my comprehension lol. Not only you, Anushka and Shado too used to tell me about his weird stares and what not! So obviously I was protective of you, so whenever I could see him getting close to you, I used to catch hold of him and take him some other way (caught him red-handed once). Definitely some 'tharki' guy hitting on you or making you feel uncomfortable in any way is a straight-up no go!

        Well, this pic doesn't ring a bell for me but idk why I like it so much. Maybe it's my funny pose or yours, or the both of us(Both of us look good here, together) or is it my bleeding boroline/vaseline (can't even remember what) applied lips. Can't even explain why I like it so damn much. maybe you know! Do tell me if you do. Will keep this one pretty brief. There's like so many things to talk about damn it! Like literally! Like seriously, look up our Whatsapp chats sometime sweetie, We can talk about anything and everything, Like you'll keep scrolling and scrolling but a day's chat just won't end. We have like 54k texts in between us on WhatsApp alone. We are super chatty people.
