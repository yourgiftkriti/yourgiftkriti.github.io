      Rahul clicked this pic from his iPhone, and I look so wide eyed like a deer under headlights. And you look like miles better than me. Like seriously. Aishu in the background crushes us both tho. She has such a photogenic face. Damn it. I have like the least photogenic face of all time. I'll just let the picture say the words this time.
