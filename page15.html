       The time you went to Bangalore to meet your "Topper" cousin from the south. Lol, how weird was she, really! couldn't really select which pic I was gonna keep so fuck it. Kept them both. I like the pic with your bro and Mom cuz your smile looks so good but I tend to the other cuz it looks a lot cooler.

       Won't be writing as much here. Except for your crazy mood swings, idk what went into you at that time, you just didn't wanna be with me. For no reason! And I was watching 13 reasons why. (Depression at the highest) which made things even worse. But you loved Bangalore, you said it was clearer than Kolkata and all. I wouldn't remember cuz I went there when I was very young. We'd bitch about Kishal and all back then. And then you'll block him and all, a lot of things happened between you and Kishal. And idk how but then we were back to where we were while you were at Bangalore.

      I just noticed there were a few pics from Bangalore in which you looked good but fuck it. For some other day maybe! Wtf were we doing at that time? I have no recollection of it. The Cbse results were out by then and both of us were busy doing stuff and going out on family trips all I believe. All I'll say to your cousin is "Yeddi mamlaku dadama"

       Happy Birthday, to the girl who has the wildest of all the mood swings ever.
