      One of my favorite pics. How do you manage to look so sexy in THAT shitty uniform? It's beyond me. Do you notice how my tie shifted from being with me to you? Whatever happened to my tie anyway? Don't tell me you just threw it at your home.

      You sent me this pic when you were getting ready for school. That'd usually be the time around when I wake up. Gawd these pics made my day! All I wanna do is just back hug you and freeze time. Remember that song? Freeze time. It'd be so perfect for this occasion. Seriously, you gotta discuss it with me, honey. Writing about it all alone feels incomplete, like the way we told our dreams, tell a part and then the other had to continue. Writing alone about it sucks really hard.

       Honey, waking up to these pics were such a tease. I mean good morning pratty! Gawd, it makes me so excited, just thinking about you and I. The very next day, you sent the same pic, just without the tie. What made up for it was your shampooed still wet hair. It's been literally ages since I last took a whiff of your hair ( along with plenty of other important stuff xD ;) Do you remember how your hair used to get out of its place and in front of your face and I used to set it back behind your ears!? It felt so seductive doing that you know. The kisses on your forehead, the kisses on your forehead (I remember I got scolded so bad for what I think was my nest kiss to your forehead of all time), the way you used to kiss my fingers when you laid your head down, and how I played with your absolutely stunningly insanely sexy breasts under the table, those times I kept your hands on your waist (damn you just loved when I did it, didn't I?) I miss them so much I can't even describe it probably think sweetheart.

        Happy birthday Kritu, the sexiest girl to ever wear the Narayana uniform and look so good!
