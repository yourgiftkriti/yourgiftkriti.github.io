      That hair! The natural dark brown, long and strong hair that drove me nuts. Please tell me you took good care of them during you vacations dude. Ik you must have lost a lot of those perfect specimen of a hair in Kota. Bring them back to their old glory baby! (Make you hair great again campaign?) in case you didn't get it, This was Trump's tagline (He's the US prez now not Obama.xD I'm just kidding with you ofc you know about it)

       When I was a kid I was proud of my hair like seriously it was super black, smooth, shiny and silky. A perfect hairs' paradise that was till I met you. I just fell in love with your natural dark brown hair. Idk when I became such a die hard fan of your hair. Maybe when we used to back hug, I used to talk a whiff of the fabulous scent of your hair. Or when we used to kiss, and I took your hair band out, which will make your hair fall out and spread it's fragrance everywhere. damn it, I hate you for not letting me do it every time. Remember how you used to stay you'll highlight your hair blonde and I told you not to go for it cuz Laboni.. cuz Bhawani (or whatever her name was I'm not good with names WTF)

      Remember when you used to tell me that'd you'll shampoo your hair? And I'll go all rogue cuz the scent be so awesome. Seriously, your choice of scents are amazing or should I say your Dad's or should I say Calvin fucking Klein(read as clean), Though you made some shitty choices too, that whatever organic shampoo you used sucked so bad! LMFAO! But you have(I should write had but I won't cuz I believe they'll be back) amazingly sexy, smooth and silky hair, and I love the chocolate brown color of your hair, as in this pic. Hair goals! You've said so yourself!
