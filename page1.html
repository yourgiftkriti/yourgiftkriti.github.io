        Quite literally the most perfect photo I have of you. Hands down this is my fav pic. Your phone's camera is equally as bad tho :P. That smile, that face, that pose, that dress, everything looks so beautiful on you(except the background maybe? Haha). Never fails to bring a smile outta me, such beauty you radiate out of this one pic. You look so perfect I wouldn't change a damn thing on you. Gawd, I fall for this pic every fucking time, you are so beautiful(Starry eyed). Maybe a crown on top of your head? Naah that'd be so old fashioned. You look absolutely flawless here. Did I mention how beautiful you look? Fuck it, even if I say it a thousand times it'd be less. <br>PS. Chrome has this stupid policy that doesn't allow autoplay. It's pissing me off.

        I don't remember when you sent me this pic but I do remember that you had gone shopping and you bought this dress and you gave me this damn awesome pic. Gawd I love this pic. You know, our old chats were deleted, phone changed so photos were gone too, but somehow I found these pics lying around. And I was reminded of such amazing times and ik how much you love these memories too. Remember we had a fight for spectre? (Probably don't but I do) How you said that I don't value memories as much as you do and then we went on to have a fight. (Pretty silly reason really) and then I said I wanted to know what was the best part about it and I went on to say about how Shunu surprised us, how we teased Aishu when Bond teased, how I ate the last Bournville that you were teasing me with, how we don't even remember the movie even a bit cuz we were so busy having fun, how you held my hand during the climax and I reassuringly kept my other hand over yours. See, I still remember. Little did we know what amazingly awesome fantactulous journey awaited us.(Damn adjectives don't exist to describe us. Gotta make my own, my book my rules.)

        The diary I gave you, I did say I'd continue right? And yeah I made little changes hope you like it. Gawd I have so much to write and so less time, damn it! I heard you like reading books xD, so here are 19 chapters of our life from probably the least famous, worst author you'll ever read(actually not probably I'd be the worst author, haha). Some chapters long, and some short, so sit back and enjoy the <s>ride</s> read sweetie.

        Happy birthday, to the girl who is no less than a damn Princess for me
