        Quite literally the most perfect photo I have of you. Hands down this is my fav pic your phone's camera is equally as bad tho :P. That smile, that face, that pose, that dress, everything looks so beautiful on you(except the background maybe?Haha). You look so perfect I wouldn't change a damn thing on you. Maybe a crown on top of your head?Naah that'd be so old fashioned. You look absolutely flawless here.<br>PS. Chrome has this stupid policy that doesn't aloow autoplay. It's pissing me off.

        I don't remeber when you sent me this pic but I do remember that you had gone shopping and you bought this dress and you gave me this damn awesome pic. Gawd I love this pic. You know, pur old chats were deleted, phone changed so photos were gone too, but somwhow I found these pics lying around. And I was reminded of such amazing times and ik how much you love these memories too. Remember we had a fight for spectre?(Probably don't but I do) How you said that I don't value memories as much as you do and then we went on to have a fight.(Pretty silly reason really) and then I said I wanted to know what was the best part about it and I went on to say about how Shunu surprised us, how we teased Aishu when Bond teased, how I ate the last bournville that you were teasing me with,how we don't even remember the movie even a bit cuz we were so busy having fun, how you held my hand during the climax and I reassuringly kept my other hand over yours. See, I still remember.

        Like in the diary I gave you, I did say I'd continue right. And yeah I made a little changes too, hope you like it. Gawd I have so much to write and so less time, damn it! I heard you like reading books xD, so here's 19 chapters of our life from probably the least famous worst author you'll ever read(actually not probably I'd be the worst author, haha). Some chapters would be long and some short, so sit back and enjoy the ride sweetie.
