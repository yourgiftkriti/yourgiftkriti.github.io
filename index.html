        I'm taking it away and I don't really know why. I don't know what is wrong with me. I'll admit I am indeed very depressed. I can't focus on studies or anything. It's different this time because I can't seem to cheer myself up no matter what I do, I can't. I tried the whole summers and I thought it worked but it clearly didn't.

        I've been trying and trying and trying and trying! Nothing seems to be working sweetie, Maybe I was hoping you to fix whatever is wrong. Kriti I'm out here crying (Yes my pillow knows all the night I've cried to sleep)! And I don't even know whats wrong with me. I feel so low sometimes I really think, well nvm. Kriti idk what to do, if I don't bother you, I have no one else. Won't you do something Kriti, is THIS too much to ask for? Have you ever noticed why I talk so low, it's not because you are on the phone(maybe partly) but because that's who I've become.

        Kriti you compare me with Shivaji and other Kota friends, do you think they have what we have? Will they ever match what we had? NO. Not even in a billion years. Kriti help me, idk I can't keep doing this any longer. It'll kill me from inside out. This time I don't know anything about it, and I don't know what to do.
