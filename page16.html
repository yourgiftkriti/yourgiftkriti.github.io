       Finally, the last pic to sum up our life in Narayana. That's pretty much me with all the girls I ever knew in Narayana. Shado ran off with Rahul, what can I say. (Jaggu says their relationship is crap, tho I want them to get married cuz Bengali wedding receptions are love.)

       Although I could write a lot here, I'll let this picture say its story. How little did we know each other just 2 years ago and now we're leaving with some amazing friends and some wonderful memories. Anushka despite bitching about her is our friend (cuz you need someone to make fun of, and what could be better than making fun of 40 people at once, maybe making fun of Kishal can top it cuz...:P)From the crazy amount of Physics and Chemistry teachers we had to the times we played volleyball with a bottle in Potty sir's physics class. From Satyam showing porn in computer classes to Amrit sir being accused of hitting Anushka. All of this fills my head with just one look at this picture.
      </p>

        I hope it brings you a different array of memories one ranging from going to the washroom to bitch about Anushka to visiting the boy's washroom. We have this bittersweet relationship with Narayana bitter cuz its shit(Its from south what can you expect) sweet cuz of the company we had. I had the time of my life here.  
      </p>
      <p>
       Happy birthday Kriti, to Narayana for making me find you.
