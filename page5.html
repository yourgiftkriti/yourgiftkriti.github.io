        Remember this pic, Idk why but I remember it so very clearly. Maybe cuz you made me work so hard to get this pic. It was when I went to Jamshedpur, my nana's place. Also, this is when we had our first fuck up. You were right, this windcheater looks so big on you XD. Haha.

        OH! I remember how I remember so much about this pic. Lol. You were like, you had your dad's windcheater and it looked so funky and big on you. I kept asking for a pic but the stubborn girl you are, just won't give me. You #. So I had an idea that we'd trade pictures and finally, that worked after idk how many hours of begging. And I gave you the one where I was sitting on the chair in my nana's place. That's how I remember it's from there. We also found out that both of our nicknames were gullu, at least mine still is. Cuz I was such a fat round kid back in the day. Even after months and months of routinely chatting we still found things in common. (Gawd, how many times have I written this common part, FML). That reminds me we had the same car and all too. WTF! And also, how we'd go to the same malls sometimes, just in different timings? Only to come back and say, "Shit you went there too?" huh, these things strike all of a sudden seriously!

        And then yeah, The fools we were back then, sometime when were chatting back then, Shunu being the super nosy guy he is, kept asking a lot of stuff to you and then he'd ask me too. You told him about R that day. Idk what was it maybe it was guilt or that you didn't tell me or idk what but you told that you've told Shunu about R. I remember very clearly that we had a big argument over it, somehow that simple thing became a mess and both of us started crying, that moment I saw a shooting star, out of all the things I could've wished for I just wished everything to be alright! Anything else seemed to have no value, what mattered was that you stopped crying and things going back to the way they were. Well, things went back for sure! But I got stuck with Anushka finding out the things I said to her and my hate-hate relationship with Shunu. But the stories not about them is it? (Not that these things weren't resolved, it went back to normal after a while or at least semi-normal) Anyway, I digressed, the story is all about you and me darling! 
      </p>
      <p>        
        Happy Birthday to you, for whom I wished everything to be alright!
