        You remember when you wore this dress? More specifically when you sent me this pic when you wore it? It was Diwali Kritu, that Diwali. You have that, "I so wanna get out of here look" really! Lmao. You look pretty tired but nonetheless, this pic reminds me of some really sweet memories.

       Idr the reason you were upset during that day, was it because K3SNM wasn't the same anymore or it was something. I don't remember now. Do you? (I bet you don't either lol). Yeah, I remember now. You were missing K3SNM so much that day, you were crying(that old you which hated crying so much, not the crybaby you are now, jk) you said you were missing you Bandel trip and all and you didn't call cuz it was you the "I hate calling people and talking to them over the phone" Kriti.  But somehow me telling that my dad was looking very funny half dressed made you laugh! In seconds you were going from "I'm about to cry" to "I'm laughing so hard rn". Maybe that's when I fell in love in making your days you know. It felt so damn good that I was able to set your mood straight. You know, I still can. (I've lost some practice, [puppy face]) Or maybe your problems get resolved by yourself.

        So there came a time when both of our moms would take our phone away cuz we be into chatting excessively. It'd be gone for days sometimes, but yeah we used to manage it somehow. But yeah I remember how your mom got super strict about your phone and she didn't give you which made you upset about it. Obviously, you hesitated to say but then again, you couldn't keep it with you and we came to know that you won't even get your phone to wish Nehal(Your closest Auxi friend I believe) Idk whose crazy idea was it to gimme your FB, so that I could write up a post on your behalf. Well, I being a # wrote it on a piece of paper and forgot to take it. I still remember how sad and upset you were that way. Somehow you got your phone that day, and I was so happy that you did. That was the day when I just couldn't bear seeing you that sad. I wrote the "Addicted to you", the first of the many long texts I wrote you. And that made you reach cloud nine(I should say sixty nine) you've no idea how happy that made me feel you know! I'm smiling like crazy even typing about that. So you texted me and you were on cloud 69 and back then I thought that you were happy cuz you got to talk to Nehal after ages but then you told me that my text made my day, you liked it so much you kept on reading and reading it. that's when I found out how much I matter to you and my words have such a charming power on you.
