       Would you look at that your smile, multiplies your beauty by infinity seriously! Altho you have your eyes closed but that smile, that damn smile! Gawd just seeing you smile is sometimes enough to make my day.

       Maybe this is our pic? Idk, I'll leave that to you. Gawd it'll take me a day to even compile what I should write here. I don't even know how to begin! We had grown so fond of each other, and gawd idk why I wanna hug you rn, for being my mbf! Remember that day in the computer lab, how we held each other's hands for the whole damn class? We didn't even care if anyone was watching us(which did become a thing with you lmao) it was just so soothing, pleasing and amazing that we didn't give a damn. Lost in our own world, didn't even know that we were holding each other's hands for that long. Only to talk about it during our winter vacations how much we loved it! And how we should've held longer.

        We clicked this pic right at the end of our classes for the year, how everyone was hugging and wishing each other there goodbyes I don't remember if we hugged or not but I know that wasn't a proper hug at all. All I know is both us wanted to hug one another but we didn't and we regretted doing that the whole vacation. How empty it used to feel you know, like that sensation when you hug me, feels so good when your lovely babies lie over my chest, feels like we are in sync, gawd that vacation I missed it real bad. I'll admit I was a shit hugger back then but hey, I've improved a lot! And your prank, that prank. Changed the world for us! I'll admit it was the best moments of my life, going through my worst now, but I'm sure it'll pass. I mean can't get any worse! Lol. You're a #! You have these crazy pranks that make me realize the importance of you, in my life. Idk, if I have said this or not but you're the spice of my life. it's so bland without you. I guess have written it here somewhere. But you know what, altho I've known you for like 3 years, it feels like I've grown up with you together. heck, I've matured so much with you, both of us have. And that prank made us realize that we are in love, one of the most emotional roller coaster I've been in. filled with ups and downs, ebbs and highs but in that small 'dt' it gave me memories of a lifetime.

        Happy birthday my girl, Queen of pranks!
