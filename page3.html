        Our z3! In full unity. Gawd this picture brings out memories. We used to look so different, didn't we? You even more so. How Narayana sheepishly got us enrolled in this batch xD. Yeah, even tho Narayana sucked it left us with some great memories. Narayana, for me, is reminiscent of all the crazy things we did here. From bunking classes to fighting with that 'mindless ass'.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't even know where to begin. The class seemed so big at the start, I was overwhelmed by the size of it (even now I get overwhelmed by huge classes). I joined late, so I didn't have any place to sit except the first bench lol. Didn't even know anyone in the class (you had 40 people known already!) but week after a week started making a few friends. I still remember the day Anushka called me to ask a doubt and I had to sit with her cuz Abhishek sir came and I had ICSE manners back then xD. Yeah, Anushka and I became fast friends, and the crazy thing about that is how she used to tell you all the crazy things about me. Like literally blabber and you kept thinking to yourself 'Who tf is this small black guy!' (but you know it already). And ofc my bet with Anushka that you liked Astrophysics. That's when we had our first talk I guess. Also, idr that friction thing that I explained to you but you say I did, so just threw in that too, maybe that was our first talk, I'm not sure.

        And then slowly we grew fast friends(classic oxymoron right there) actually we quickly became fast friends. Those were the times we spent more time chatting in WhatsApp rather than at school. Only when we used to have lunch would we go together. And most of the classes Anushka would sit adjacent to me and you to her side with Chintan, Harshal, and Anuska to your side. Then we sort of formed an unofficial friends circle. Slowly Anuska Harshal faded away later to be joined by Shunu and Aishu, we started teasing Anushka for having 'affairs' with everyone and a list was made. That list. From Tuneer to Tamojit that was a looooong list! And your classic "Think about it" and we all know what that resulted in. Gawd, how many nights have we been up bitching about Anushka! Damn it feels countless. From Aishu to Santanu, everyone started bitching about her so hard. Gawd and we're such jerks we used to enjoy it so much( can't help it tho, she just has that freaking nature that makes everyone's blood boil). I'm still angry at her for that. But yeah, those countless nights we spent talking about her, we gradually became so comfortable and close to each other. We started hanging out together, you used to sit adjacent to me that made Anushka go so jelly, and we'd laugh and bitch about her. It was so fun. (Heck even after a year you and Rimil would go to the WASHROOM just to bitch on her).She's such a mood lifter dude. Angry about something, just bitch about Anushka and everything's all right. That was the beginning of our time in z3.
