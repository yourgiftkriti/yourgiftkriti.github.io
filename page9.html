       One of our first and few meets that we had. And damn, I know your eyes are closed and all but damn that smile sweetie . I guess maybe that's why I like your smile more when your eyes are closed, feels a lot more genuine feels like it's from the deepest of deep happiness and it makes me go all gaga! you look at that your smile, multiplies your beauty by infinity seriously! Altho you have your eyes closed but that smile, that damn smile! Gawd just seeing you smile is sometimes enough to make my day.

       Gawd, look closely, Bakshi looks freaking photoshopped. We have been to dp thrice I think. All for watching movies except this first one I suppose. How we called Bakshi an hour later and he came 2 hours later. And remember how the security kicked us out because we weren't having any food. Holy shit! I had almost forgotten about it. It's DP! When my hands met their home. No, wait they have 2 homes. Fuck it one for each hand. Gawd, your waist is so sexy! Like for real in school you typically wore a tank top within it so I couldn't get a proper feel of your waist but damn that day! I saw that you weren't wearing any kind of tank top within it and my hands were slipping over your shirt like melted butter. I knew I had to hold you by your waist. And when I did, my hands touching your skin that was soft as silk and pulling you closer by the waist! Gawd it makes me so excited even now. And the look on your face, I'll never forget that look. Surprise, excitement, shock, anxiety, happiness, love it had everything. Damn it, I so wanna be with you rn and do the same thing all over again. That was the most perfect face I have seen my entire life, your eyes are damn expressive sweetie I'll give you that. I was able to read it off of your eyes. I'm never forgetting that face.

       And about our kisses! I should let you write them, you literally could write an essay(I should say composition, English test right) you'd even beat Shakespear at that and I'm not even kidding. Tbh you know, our second kiss sucked more than the first one in my opinion. You know the craziest thing tho, when you told me about the kiss with Shubham(You are the biggest # ever) the most satisfying thing to hear was that I was way better kisser than him. From hearing our dreams to the badmaashi I did, it was sweet and sexy at the same time. Practice does make perfect! It's been ages since I last kissed. Don't know how much more do I have to wait. Could write about a lot of things here, but it's better when you join in with me, xD. Gawd, and just take an appointment already! The doctor misses those babies so bad rn!

        Happy birthday, to the most mind-numbingly and insanely beautiful smile I've ever seen. (Could compliment a lot more about that damn smile, but that's for some other day.)
