       Don't have any pic for the time you went to Kota so I guess will have to work with this that was clicked at one of the last moments of your time away from home. You look so so much more cuter than you already do, with that pout and the pose.Damn, I love this pic(3rd or 4th fav in here) That dress/strap denim really looks so good on you.Gawd I just wanna photobomb that pic and take you away with me and tell you how beautiful you look here xD.

       I can literally write hundreds of pages full of our memories when you were in Kota(okay maybe not a hundred but definitely more than 10). From the amazing times we spent on the phone to those times where we had fights and misunderstandings. You remember how you used to tell me not to call you cuz it,d be distracting you and all? Maybe you don't but I do.thats was when I came to college around the month of July, and you were such a changed girl back then! You used to hate the people there always used to complain that you didn't like people there that you find people repelling? which made you not wanna talk to anyone at all? (Finding similarities sweetie ;) and from there to finding friends like Shivangi and Anmol with whom you had these crazy experiences and then finding new friends with Shubham, Sagrika and the girl with the most forgettable name of all time. Yeah, a lot of times you'd say AP and Shivangi keep telling you that you got new friends and that you've forgotten about them but in the end, you talk to them the most rn. Along with Shubham and Sagrika lol(Don't say now that you don't talk to him).I don't even know where to begin. How I'd wait for your call and you'll tell me all these crazy incidents from Mehendi to those lame ass Shubham jokes(seriously even Kishal makes better jokes than that) somehow you started feeling better but there you were, back to the usual self you always were. Fun loving, carefree but serious into studies. Remeber 15th August? Independence day celebrations were going on ("Mehendi Pandey bahar nikal" lolxD) and we talked and talked and talked. That night was special because after a really long time we told that we loved each other. And all the time you kept saying "Why did you say that so late sweetheart?"I'm smiling while I am writing this, you know that's how precious this memory is to me (Hold on to this sentence Kritu) . We'd keep talking every day for an hour or even more and you'd get angry and punish me by saying we won't talk the next day, only to talk for another hour the very next day xD. Idk how quite to put it but you know those little moments, I lived for them. Idk if I have said this before but yeah we didn't talk a lot a lot but whenever we did it felt like, complete. Talking to you made my day perfect and making you laugh, gawd don't even begin at that, how can I even explain how I feel when I make your day or make you smile. Trust me when I say this there's nothing I really mean no better feeling in the whole damn multiverse that can top that. (Expect you paying me a surprise visit when I'm home alone xD or anywhere alone Idc ;) It is like you're the flavor of my life hon, without you my life feels bland it lacks that special something, it lacks the laughter, the happiness, the craziness, and everything we are. It lacks you, Your Awesomeness!

        Some mistakes were made, some deliberate some completely unintentional. Idk at some point I'll admit I held myself back cuz I didn't want to disturb your studies, you probably won't believe it but one of the last things I wanna do is lie on your birthday ffs.(I know how much of a dumb thing that was now) I should've discussed it out with you idk why I chose not to. So I didn't call when I missed you, I didn't call when I needed you I chose to control myself(for the most part) now Ik why you call me a bigger # than you. Somewhere in my mind you saying that you are not able to focus in your studies long time back(in our initial stages and during boards) really affected me, I didn't wanna be a reason. I didn't know its gonna turn out to be the worst decision of my life. And it slowly took a toll on us and things began rolling downhill. We started taking each other for granted I guess. You'd always prioritize talking to your Kota friends over the phone and then it made me feel like I don't matter to you and we began having these petty fights(which we still do cuz we are #es really! xD. Alright I agree I'm the bigger # here) Ik you're angry upon me for this but forgive me :P Misunderstandings happen and then due to the circumstances we couldn't solve them soon enough. But that phase has passed now, it's time we put the pieces together,together :P. I mean how can I turn my back on that cute little baby pose(I'm going gaga on how cute you look in that pic ).

       Happy Birthday to my girl who has the cutest poses my eyes ever behold!
