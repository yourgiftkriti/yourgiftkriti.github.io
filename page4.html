        Can't remember when you sent me this pic, but yeah it was somewhere around 2015. Around the time we used to talk a lot, a lot. And we had so so much fun talking about random bullshit. And gawd, seeing those earphones. How my hands used to pain while holding the phone so that I could talk to you and you had such 'great' quality headphones that were so good at canceling noise, all I could hear were the sounds of wind blowing. (Exactly what I wanna hear, who cares for the shit you say, right?)

        Picking up where I left off, we became fast friends one of the reasons was the absolute frankness we have, and we didn't mind whatever questions we asked each other cuz we are so comfortable with each other. Gradually, we built trust, we told each other our secrets. You told me about R, I told you about Rimmy and Sal(crush really, I was such a kid back then). We grew closer each day, how proud I used to feel that you trust me with your secrets and how one day you confessed that I had become a better friend than R ever was. Idk the pretext on how or when you said that, but it made my day! (It was probably one of the misunderstandings we had). Indeed, we had a very special friendship that grew so strong so quickly. How we had so much in common. Like literally felt like I've known you my entire life just didn't know where to find you. (This awfully feels like a deja vu, I have written the exact same words before). How we used to call each other twins. Our hi-fis whenever we found another thing in common(Like seriously we used to do that 69 times a day). And how we used to say it's a // universe. Gawd, there were so so many things we had in common.

        You know, I learned how to make someone's day when he/she is upset with you. I owe you that one. You had that art to make someone smile when they were crying you know. I picked up that knack from you, I was pretty dumb I didn't know what to do when that used to happen(Alright, Alright I am a #). Can't count how many nights I made up your mood when you got upset, be it R or crossing roads. Maybe that made us know each other even more and build upon our friendship, that knew no bounds. The replies of 'I hate you' changed from 'I hate you too', to 'I love you, as a friend ofc' to 'I love you'(Still as a friend but we ignored that part)Which got us into trouble later on. Remember the day you ignored me af! And then you said it was cuz of the text and that your mom saw that which created a mess? Gawd, idk how but I remember that I'm glad that was resolved as quickly as it happened tho. Such was our friendship back then. Somewhere along that line, we became each others mbf, it'd've been a shame to be best friends cuz it couldn't do justice to our strong bond(ionic, covalent co-ordinated xD. Okay that was lame. Haha). And as amazing as it was it grew even more. We were mbfs who shared everything with each other. We promised rather that we'd share everything and I'm proud that it was with you.
