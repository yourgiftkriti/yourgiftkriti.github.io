       And we land in this pic. One of the few rare group pics where we weren't together. In this case I am not in this pic at all. Well, this one's all about the bong from Bonga! The idiotic Kishal babu. Ham tumhe beizzat kyu karte hai? Dk sir, has that vision. Couldn't have said anything better. If Narayana had a yearbook that line would win the best one liner award for sure.

       Idk when but yeah Kishal and we got pretty close (to the point I thought something might have been going on between you two. (So, silly of me lol) We formed the Bk club and all and every time either my place or Kishal's was shifted cuz we be disturbing each other so much. Kishal became stranger by the day he found out about us. He'd keep asking that personal stuff and all which made me hate him, like despise him idk what but that made me wanna push him away. Then he found a friend in you, started having problems with me and it turned into a commotion. I made him a promise that he would not tell you under any circumstances, his feelings. (I was pretty sure he'd have grown past it) but the fool he is kept dropping the hints. I tried to protect and prepare you for that but you being the # that you are (I told you with Shubham too), I had to see you cry. Like literally waterfall down your eyes. How could you expect me to sit and do nothing? I knew I had to do something. And that's how the "Ladies washroom" thing became a thing.

      It'd be the first time our parents would find out about us, which complicated things further. But "Let me sin one last time?" helped us out, didn't it? Yeah, things went back to normal, in hiding this time. We got pretty used to it until, you kept my anniversary gift on your fucking bag, you #! (Obviously, someone would check it Miss Smart pants). It was a roller coaster but yeah we made things out somehow. Saw through these phases.

       Happy birthday, to the most biggest # I've ever met.
