        There was a time where we didn't know each other. We came to know about each other through a bet! How silly is that, but that's how some unique, different, amazing and awesome things start right?(Apple, Microsoft, Us xD).

        Your auxilium photo, to your photos with "back benchers", to Debosmit's birthday. Yeah, there was a time we celebrated HIS birthday! Let's take a moment and think about that. Wtf! Now that I think about it, we've come a long way from that. We really have haha. We even bought a cake and what not for him. Straight up celeb treatment, gawd can't even think what would Kshitij and Satyam do if they find out about this. So, there was a time when we didn't know each other. You used to hang out with your bus mates and all on the back benches of our old classroom and I,d be there in the first benches, the time before z3! Feels like history really. Rimil would answer all the questions in a jiffy and we'd just stare at her while she does her "typical" blush. And Khamoosh classes, man y'all used to insult him so much, I felt bad for him tbh xD. You remember how Sahil topped the first Math test? Seriously dude what a fluke! Still can't believe that. Didn't know you in person but I did tell you how we came 'in contact' with each other right?(My hands knew where they belong xD haha). Well, that's pretty much about it during that phase. We didn't know each other till then.

        And even before Narayana was the Auxilium phase, wouldn't know much about it(Except that it's shittier than Loyola, haha). But we did go through similar things in our lives. Be it being introverted before to getting caught during exams. (I once cheated in my ODIA exam and they gave me -20 or something). Ik you did it once but still, that's so funny xD. Your parents were called for a class test wtf. And obviously the K3SNM or K3SN or idk that's not a thing anymore. But yeah, those times were fun. The best group ever right?

        Happy birthday Kriti, the girl whom I hadn't known yet.
