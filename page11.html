      You look cute in this pic, like an adorable little baby. Maybe it's cuz of your pose or that you look pretty cute in general (Except when you're angry ofc or crying) Hey, it's the pic that you kept as your WhatsApp dp! Europe is so beautiful tho. Perfect holidaying destination! (if that's a word)

      Hardly a few months you slapped me hard cuz of Europe. Seriously, you really hit me hard. And then your Dad had this amazing idea of the Europe trip at the right moment. You were so hyped for the trip. It was literally your dream to visit Europe. That was the time Jayanta sir used to take our classes, we had such an amazing short kiss during one of his extra classes. Like seriously best short kiss in the whole damn universe. Sweet, short, sexy and seductive all the S's you need. We made out in the second last extra class there was, almost getting caught by the guards and all. Damn, writing alone about our kisses and romances feels so lonely, if only you could join me! And remember the last extra class? How we just spend that day talking to each other, only to say we should've made out. Haha, xD. But it was what we needed back then. You gave me a lift to my place, that was the first time I met your driver. How smitten he was to see me. Yeah, I have that effect on guys like Anshuman, Debjyoti and you :P. You were popping your head out of the window of your car, enjoying the breeze, you look so good when you close your eyes and smile. Maybe that's why I used to love the gesture you did when I said my countless 'I love you's. I mean you smiling from the deepest depths of your heart is all you need to make my day.

      And then when you were about to go I'd write the second most relevant long texts that I always do. You loved it so much that'd you go to the bathroom just to read it! It still makes me grin from ear to ear thinking about that. (Yeah I blush too but you'll never know cuz I'm black) It makes me so fucking delighted that my writings have such a power on you, it's these things that give me the confidence that you'll love the things I write. Yeah, Europe was rough too! We had a fight cuz I slept and you couldn't talk to me but everyone else was there, something along that line. (Fucking silly in retrospect, I know) But how long can you stay away from your black dawg, as faithful as a shadow? Yeah, we had fought only to make up and strengthen our bond!

       Happy birthday Kritu, the girl who's the most beautiful and charming girl from the inside out!
