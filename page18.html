       <s>I hate you for not sending me this pic.</s> I love you for not sending me what I wanted but a whole lot more. So now you know I wasn't lying with my genuine reason. I won't lie to you #. And for something as serious as that. Uh Uh never ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had so much bottled up feelings that I wanna talk to about but I don't have your time. You are busy with all the work which you have and I don't even have a track of all the things that I wanted to say. Just read the whole thing before thinking anything else (I know you are justifying why you didn't have time, trust me on this one, I genuinely know, I have been through it). I can't help but notice the similarities b/w the situation we were in a few months ago and where we are rn, just a change of roles I'd say. Now I know how that feels. Wanting to talk to the only person you truly care about but he doesn't have time for you, even tho he says you still matter to him, which obviously one won't believe(but I didn't lie when I said that I missed you or that I was thinking about you. And I never will lie about it ever!). Maybe it's Karma(or my Dad, he has the same name lol) and maybe it's getting back at me. I'm not afraid to admit that we have problems even tho we try to run them over with, I know it lingers on and the worst part of it all is we don't even wanna discuss it. But I do. I care too much about us to let it all go. I hate that we are not getting time for each other. The whole summers were about realizing my mistake, and I'm really afraid you are walking down the same part. I'm sorry Kritu I couldn't be there for you when you needed me, no matter how much I stress upon it, it won't do any good now. Now maybe you can imagine how tough it was to balance b/w all the things and I was being thrown responsibilities that I didn't want, food that I wouldn't eat even if it increases my height(hey, for that may be) and above all my laziness to try and sort out the mess I made out of my life. Yeah, I lost touch with my family, ignored calls from Sai to Manish and above all the things I lost you, your trust, your hopes, and your promises. The act of the assless asshole you'll ever meet.I'm just a small fun loving kid Kriti and with all that shit happening, I ran away from it and when I turned back and realized it'd been too late.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not perfect Kriti, after coming back(May first week I think) I was so eager to talk to you but your mom was around that time and I can't even describe how awfully afraid of your mom I even then. And then when you did call me, I was so happy you know, like a spark had just clicked but that's when it started. You left saying your mom would come home and I told you to say that you are talking to Shubham or someone, and that's when I realized after you said that you talked to him before calling me, that somewhere I have lost that special place I held in your heart. It felt like I was always seconded. Not only by him, by Shivangi, by Anmol and all your other Kota friends. and I'm pretty sure you felt the same when you thought I had no time for you and I'm busy with my friends here. Now you know how wrong it is to think that. You matter the most to me Kriti, if anything, I learned, rather promised this summer that I'd get my shit together and fix my priorities and not be lazy(time management). Now, I talk to my parents daily(at least till now) and don't procrastinate my work rather keep it organized. Didn't have a bath in 3 days tho (Rip bath cuz of 8am classes.FML)

       Happy Birthday to the busiest mbf there ever will be. And I understand, I have been there.
