       I saved the best for the last (Second best actually, the first would be the Princess one xD). Is it me or are you looking even more sexier than before? It's me right! Or maybe a better camera! Told ya, a good camera makes a difference. Those shorts tho, they look so sweet, short and sexy on you! Gawd, those legs look so good. ( Fine leg Lol, cricket joke. No? Okay)

       It's your birthday Kritu and I'm so hyped for it. I have a few things to say but idk how quite to put it. But here goes nothing. You know the toughest part in making this gift was staying motivated, when I start writing I also start missing these amazing memories and I wanna talk to you, cuz it makes me wanna miss you badly. So there's your answer for me being nosy, most of the time I'd be writing for you but just not being able to talk to you when I really wanted to, made me all angry and nosy and shit. So yeah, maybe I had been a bit weird lately, but finally, I'm glad I was able to come through it all.

        You know, I wasn't a believer of fate or anything but it changed when I met you. I guess it was fate that led me to you, else we'd probably have ended up somewhere in the south. Remember the fight we had when we were in Kota, the one where you sent that text that I didn't get maybe that was fate too. Maybe it's fate that my password had 25718 in it, although I meant 18 as in our age. Maybe it's a sign. All this time I was afraid that I'd mess things up. But I'll be a fool if I mess up this chance. I don't wanna regret it. Sweetheart, no matter what a part of me will always love you no matter what. I still love you, maybe as your mbf, as a companion, as a lover I really don't know. But I can't deny that I don't. Heck Kriti, I've grown with you maybe not physically but emotionally. You are the only constant of my life. Remember the fated "y=k" equation? How can I let someone come and differentiate that, I'd be left with zero. I gotta integrate it, indefinite one at that, to get that k back. (AGL sir would definitely fall for this line). Heck, we're connected physically, biologically, chemically and even mathematically. What else do people of science need? Kritu, yeah there had been some misunderstandings that couldn't be resolved due to our circumstances. All of these circumstances added to infinity. My whole life was turned upside down Kriti. Now I wanna get out of here. (Stranger things reference lol).

       I hate a lot of things about you. I hate the fact that I can't even stay mad at you for a day. I hate the fact that I sometimes spoil your day and fail to make up for it. I hate the fact that I make you irritated for petty little things. I hate how things are between us presently. I somehow found these pics and I fell in love with them, the memories, our love, EVERYTHING! It was so amazing, it'll suck if we went down like this Kriti. I can't, not like this. Even I'm afraid of commitment and the future but I don't care. All I want right now is to be with you one more time. We have to find some middle ground or something sweetie. At least we should try, that's the least we can do for old time's sake, work a few things out, remove the friction between us, I don't wanna regret not taking this chance.

        It's your birthday sweetheart! Party hard today. Like always it'll be alright!
        <br>Happy birthday Kriti, my #, my special someone, and my soulmate!</p>
